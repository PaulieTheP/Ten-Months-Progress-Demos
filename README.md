Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25)




Purpose of this document 
1.	To survey members who initially joined and became and either chose not to attend any more meetings or lost interest in the DiEM25 movement entirely. To inform these drifting members of progress and upcoming actions.

2.	To recruit new members and give them a short summary of the history and purpose of DiEM25 and why they should care and Join and participate in the movement. A wise man among us said a movement cannot move without movers.
3.	To enlist help from both groups above to organise and execute the March assemblies in Ireland. 



DiEM25 first birthday celebration, 9 February 2017
DiEM25 will be one year old next February and progress in this first ten months has been slower than all involved would have hoped. However the initial set up phase is nearing an end and we are now ready to address our true purpose for existing. Find below progress to date and an outline of why democracy is threatened in the EU.


33% of Europeans still have faith in the European Union (Eurobarometer, 2012) http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb78/eb78_first_en.pdf . Nobody wants to be glass half full but 77% of Europeans that is 391,160,000 people! Of 508,000,000 people! (Europa.eu) Have either lost or never had faith in the EU.
Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25)

Europe must democratise or it will disintegrate!

Strategy R Rumelt
A good strategy is a coherent specific approach for overcoming the obstacles to progress. (Rumelt, 2011)


DiEM25 First Ten Months
The Progressive Agenda for Europe (PAE) was launched at the inauguration in Berlin 9 February 2016, this formed the basis for the DiEM25 Manifesto, and both documents can be changed by member vote.

Progressive Agenda for Europe (PAE)
1.	Transparency, introducing transparent government across Europe.
2.	Refugees and migration.
3.	European New Deal: Rationalising Europe’s economy.
4.	Labour, technology, employment and the distribution of income, beyond the capital labour contract, basic income.

WeMove.EU
When you join DiEM25 you will receive emails from WE Move.EU http://wemove.eu/ a partner organisation. We Move runs campaigns against corruption and the threat to democracy from the power of the corporate lobby GM foods and humanitarian issues. Example: trade deals (TTIP, CETA, TPP) and free market fundamentalism and how neoliberalism threatens democracy.

The Threats to Democracy
Massively powerful corporate lobbies with a neoliberal laissez faire dogma are the rot at the core of all so called democracies, Europe is a prime example of this phenomenon. Financial institutions hold governments and peoples to ransom. Capitalism has no legitimacy without true democracy, most western democracies are not democracies in the true sense. Does the US regulate lobbies are better than the EU’s? It would seem so which is shocking if true.
Unregulated markets generate capital accumulation much quicker than they generate growth, this leads to stagnant economies, increasing concentrations of wealth for the top 0.01% and increasing hardship and impoverishment for everyone else. Less invisible hand more invisible jack boot.
The Thatcher Regan era heralded the start of the war on labour, which was carried into the Blair Clinton era with their third way which was merely neo liberalism through the back door, less new left more new left out. At the level of the firm this war was waged through the rhetoric of human resource management, which tries to serve two masters diametrically opposed interests.
Globalisation touted as a means of bringing billions out of poverty was in effect the neoliberal antidote to powerful unions, strikes are a blunt weapon in this globalised world where large corporations can simply move rather than negotiate with unions. By any rational unbiased evaluation at the end of the 1970’s the balance of power had swung far too far in unions favour leading to a backlash from big business.
When unions are strong profits suffered, but the current world order is financially and ecologically unsustainable. Shareholders rights are sacrosanct, humanity and earth are a poor second, CSR and the balanced scorecard etc. are merely lip service from the PR department.
